I'm going to do a super duper minimal experiment.

I want to test the efficacy of

- gridlines
- examples
- encodings

Ah, there's some more but I can't remember.

So I need to figure out a few things:

- how to track and display inputs (messages, grids, images, etc)
- how to track and display output (diffs, images, etc)
- how to package a particular state (git commit + some docs?)
-
