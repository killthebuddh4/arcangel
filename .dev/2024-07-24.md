# Overview

So I'm working on a kind of visual shell for the LLMs to operate on grids.

LLM conversation workflows/pipelines get out of control super duper fast, so I
need to spend just a little bit time adding some structure and instrumentation.
It's a tricky balance because you don't want to get too crazy on the detail but
you also really need to have a lot of control on the finicky details in order to
be confident that you know what's going on.
