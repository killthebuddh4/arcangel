There's

--> operator
- things that just do a thing, e.g. "draw"

these are hard coded

--> primitive (because we want to  build a DSL full of these)
- things that do semantic things "fillRegion"

these are "just functions" but they are generated

--> computation (a bundle of transformations? a branching transformation?)
- things that do multiple semantic things

these are implemented by agents inside a shell

---

So the parameters to operators are generated. Which means they can fail.

Maybe a transformation is just a sequence of operators?


---

So the idea is to use an LLM and operators to implement a transformation.


----

overall, the process for a runtime is:

boot

while (notError && notFinished) {
    execute an operator

}


----

tool -> wraps an operator


----

Reasons for a "createFoo"

- reduce LoC
- guarantee side effects are run
- parse input variables
- symmetric (everything has a createX)
