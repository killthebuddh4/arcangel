i think the first metric we will consider is

efficiency = numTokens / progress
success = progress === 100;

so it looks like the usage reporting is buggy in the openai repsonse

They may be at least consistent though, then I could numTokens.


I want a couple things for the rough-and-reaady version

- a human-readable transcript
- a human-readable progress chart
-

_one liner for glanceing at experiment results_

for f in data/images/sessions/*; do for d in $f/experiment.json; do cat $d | jq '.history | .[-1].progress'; done; done
