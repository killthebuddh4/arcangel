So right now we're kind of thinking that a "Model" is like a "session" or a
"session in a shell" or a "shell." 


The idea is that there is always this kind of working memory.

What's the difference between

- memory
- session
- model

Well? They're all kind of intertwined, maybe like

session > memory > model

or something like that. But for now for simplicity we just have a model.

So one thing I should note is:

__A primitive is a function that takes a Field AND INPUTS__

__An operator is a function that takes ONLY A FIELD__


The distinction is important because we are trying to build something that
generalizes across all different kinds of fields. The act of generalization is
kind of like "DELETING ALL PARAMETERS" right?

Like when you generalize you basically say "you no longer need this particular
parameter, you just figure it out yourself"

So like you can imagine what we're doing as something like
a learning process that goes

PRIMITIVES -> OPERATORS

Or something like that.

Also, I might want to swap the actual names we use. A "PRIMITIVE" could be like
a "thing in the DSL" and I feel like the "thing in the DSL" should be the thing
that doesn't have parameters. So what is a "more fundamental" term: primitive or
operator?
