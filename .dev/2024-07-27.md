So right now we're kind of thinking that a "Model" is like a "session" or a
"session in a shell" or a "shell." 


The idea is that there is always this kind of working memory.

What's the difference between

- memory
- session
- model

Well? They're all kind of intertwined, maybe like

session > memory > model

or something like that. But for now for simplicity we just have a model.
