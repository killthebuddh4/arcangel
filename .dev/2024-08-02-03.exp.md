# Failure Modes

A ton of the sessions look like they ended in errors, which I don't record. So I'm going to re-run with better error tracking.

# Notes

The only success was a single iteration: 64 tools all at once. __Maybe this is an important data point, maybe the model will perform significantly better in one shot?__ This sounds plausible to me because it reduces accumulated error. There may be a fundamental tradeoff between recovery possibility and one-shotness though. What I mean is it's easier to recover from small steps, but it's extremely likely some small step will fail.


# Next

- add error tracking and try again.
