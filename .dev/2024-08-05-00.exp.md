# Overview of Parameters

I changed the examples to be more descriptive. Instead of a couple solid grids, I provide a number (5) of tool calls and the results they would have on a target grid.

}
```

# Failure Modes


# Notes

A couple of the examples I gave are "factors" of the grid. I.e. you can add a bunch of them up to fit perfectly in the grid. If this experiment goes really well, I have a feeling that will be why. I should probably try to see how the model does if I only give "asymmetric" or "random" tool calls. Like "here's 5 random points in the call, and here's the result grid."

# Next

- use a less-powerful annealer
- use better examples (maybe without the annealer)
