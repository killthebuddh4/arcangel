# Overview of Parameters

Gave the model a tool to learn the indexes of the cells.

# Directional Change

Very good, only 1 failure.

# Failure Modes

1 OOB failure. The model in this case did not ever call getDimensions.

# Notes

The model chose to call getDimensions 37 times out of 50. So if I just delete that tool and then measure the OOB errors, I can get a feel for the efficacy.

# Next

- Remove the tool and run again.
