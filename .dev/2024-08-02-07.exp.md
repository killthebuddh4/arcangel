# Overview of Parameters

I added to the stall annealer an example of an unfilled cell.


# Directional Change

18/20 success is a big positive change. That said, many of the successes are the already-seen 0-1-64 or 0-1-40-72 kind of bulk-call successes. The stall annealer did seem to get a few of the stuck processes unstuck though.

# Failure Modes

The two failures are

- 1 premature "this isn't working exit". i.e. the stall annealer kicks in after 5 stuck iterations, but the model detected the stuck-ness at 3 iterations I think
- randomly asking if the model should continue

# Notes

I'm not a huge fan of the stuck annealer solution because it explicitly provides a partial solution to the model which means of course that it only works if we already know the answer. I think I'm going to run the current version another 100 times or so to see if I can pick up any other signals.

# Next

- do more runs
- use a less-powerful annealer
- use better examples (maybe without the annealer)
