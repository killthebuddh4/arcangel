# Overview of Parameters

Generate an X instead of a solid grid.

# Directional Change

Hard bad.

# Numbers

```
N/A - Terminated the experiment early.
```

# Failure Modes

It basically just cannot track the "X", or generate it, or something. It just fails.

# Notes

Ok, so how am I going to get the model to reproduce the "X"?
One thing I could do is give the model more structured tools like "setSquare", "setLine", "setRow", "setColumn". I'm not a huge fan of that because I'm trying to let the model do that work.

ASIDE: The diff progress calc is kind of bad now, an empty grid is like 90% progress because of all the matching black squares.

# Next

I'm going to see if I can just get the model to tell me what it sees.
