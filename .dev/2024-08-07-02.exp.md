# Overview of Parameters

Use gpt-4o instead of mini.

# Directional Change

Slight improvement, but not good.

# Numbers

```
Basically 0/10 success.

```

# Failure Modes

The model did a better job of describing the red cells but still failed pretty hard. It noticed a "T-shape" or "some kind of pattern". Most responses said the grid is 7x7 but one said 8x8.

I'm curious if Claude would do better.
