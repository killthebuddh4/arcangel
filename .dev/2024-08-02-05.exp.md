# Overview of Parameters

I added a natural language description DIFF_FEEDBACK. After the model's tool calls are executed, we count the remaining unfilled cells and add a message that says how many cells are left.


# Directional Change

Big positive. From 5% to ~60%.

# Failure Modes

Of the 7 failures, 6 were stalled progress.

# Notes


# Next

I'm going to add a progress annealer to shake the model out of stalling.
