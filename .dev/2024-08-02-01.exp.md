# Overview of Parameters

So the only thing I changed from the previous experiment was using `gpt-4o` instead of `gpt-4o-mini`. There was basically __O__ change in either direction, so I'm just going to keep using the mini model for now and every now and then switch to the bigger model to see what happens.

# Next

- try bigger and smaller grids
- include an explicit diff that says progress (to avoid early exits)
- try non-vision models
