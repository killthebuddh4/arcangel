so a model of a thing  is a thing you can run
to make predictions


so it's a thing that evolves faster than the thing it models

well or it could be cheaper

say you could run a fusion experiment and it would take 1 second and 100 million
euros

or you could run a program for a year that would cost 100 dollars or
something like that

so a model is a thing that consumes less input than the real thing

well, not necessarily

it could also just be safer

a model is just a thing that maps in some way to some other thing while having
some of its characteristics be different


So the protocol is something like this:


loop:
  - choose an operation
  - apply the operation

or in more detail

loop:
    - choose an operation

    - while not applied
        try to apply

        if success
            return

        if max errors
            throw

        retry

Michael Hodel's approach:

In any case it seems there'll be a select/apply process also for choose the
operation. If  the operation has paremeters the select is like choose params, if
the operation has no parameters then the select is like choosing a target
region.


Riffing a bit, what "agents" do I need? ->

really it's what agent/protocol/prcess, but let's see:


- generate operation
    - generate description
    - generate code
- generate predicate
    - generate description
    - generate code
- parameterize operation
- apply operation
- validate result
- select state to iterate
- evaluate branch/tree

i need some process for adding/removing predicates from things too, i.e. some
kind of narrowing/widening operation

oh, do we want some __IDEA OF TYPES__

like type FieldWithShapes = {}
type SymmetricField = {};

actually I already have that really using the list of predicates

__I NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT PATH TO TAKE INTO THIS, I.E. WHAT IS THE FIRST
THING I CAN TRY TO IMPLEMENT THAT DOESN'T DEPEND ON THE REST__

Oh also, remember what the first MVP is:
- generate a copy of an image
