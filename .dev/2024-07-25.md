so a model of a thing  is a thing you can run
to make predictions


so it's a thing that evolves faster than the thing it models

well or it could be cheaper

say you could run a fusion experiment and it would take 1 second and 100 million
euros

or you could run a program for a year that would cost 100 dollars or
something like that

so a model is a thing that consumes less input than the real thing

well, not necessarily

it could also just be safer

a model is just a thing that maps in some way to some other thing while having
some of its characteristics be different
