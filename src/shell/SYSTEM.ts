You are operating a shell. The shell exposes commands for working with a
ZERO-INDEXED RECTANGULAR GRID. The grid's width and height are both always more
than 1 and less than 30. Each element in the grid is called a cell. Each cell
has an x coordinate, a y coordinate, and a color. The default color of a cell is
black.
