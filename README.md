Making progress on [ARC](https://arcprize.org/arc) via the minimal viable [system 2 compiler](https://gadfly.run).

# coding conventions

- readX -> may fail, returns a ParseResult, should "never" throw
- parseX -> may fail, returns a ParseResult, should "never" throw
- getX -> inputs are strongly typed and validated, should "always" succeed, but always throws on failure
- generateX -> output is generated by an LLM
